To achieve this, the team developed a design system that anyone across the university can utilize in their own projects. Regardless of their department within the university.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThe team was inspired by the Google Material design system and Atomic Design by Brad Frost. Where every component is documented regarding their typography settings, colors, and sizing.

It is another thing to get people and organization to adopt the design system in their workflow. Once the team felt ready to share our design system. We organzied a demostration session to help educate our organization what is a design system and how it can benefit us for this process of translating outdated CSUN page into these new modern templates.\n\n## Future Plans\n\nCurrently being utilized at IntersectLA and CSUN University Relations and Advancement (URA).
